== 0. PURPOSE ==
 This project was created to make the Arduiono Leonardo work as a mouse and keyboard at the same time.
 The mouse can send input that uses various BÃ©zier curve algorithms to o make the mouse movements more human-like.

== 1. PREREQUISITES ==

 This project requires:
  * Windows (CMake) v3.8.1+
  * MSVC

== 2. BUILDING ==
 
 This project uses the Windows (CMake) build system. However, I
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

== 3. INSTALLING ==

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".

== 4. CONTRIBUTING ==

 TODO: Enhance section.
